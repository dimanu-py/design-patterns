## Project

This repository contains a collection of design patterns that I'll be learning. The main objective is to implement each design pattern using Python and Java to see the differences and gain a deeper understanding of the concept of each design pattern.

The project will have one folder per design pattern. Each folder will contain the following files:

* **README.md**: it should explain the design pattern, with the class diagram and key aspects of the design.
* **python**: implementation of the design pattern in Python
* **java**: implementation of the design pattern in Java

## Patterns covered

1. [Command Pattern](https://github.com/dimanu-py/design-patterns/tree/main/command_pattern)
2. [State Pattern](https://github.com/dimanu-py/design-patterns/tree/main/state_pattern)
3. [Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/dimanu-py/design-patterns/tree/main/strategy_pattern)
