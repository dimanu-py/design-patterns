## Project

This repository contains a collection of design patterns that I'll be learning. The main objective is to implement each design pattern using Python and Java to see the differences and gain a deeper understanding of the concept of each design pattern.

The project will have one folder per design pattern. Each folder will contain the following files:

* **README.md**: it should have an explanation of the design pattern, with the class diagram and key aspects of the design.
* **python**: implementation of the design pattern in Python
* **java**: implementation of the design pattern in Java

## Patterns covered

1. Command Pattern
